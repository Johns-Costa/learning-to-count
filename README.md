### Bugs

- ##### Solved bugs

  - I could not make the catterpillar sections change color while selecting the divs.
  - I fixed it by using targeting the different section - document.getElementById('body-part-' + event.target.innerText).
  
  - I could not make Level 2 accept a sellected pattern even when it was matching the pattern2
  - I fixed it by debugging it with devtools and finding out the the "incorrect answers" was in the correct answers of the function instead of the "correct answers"

- ##### Unsolved bugs

  - None.
